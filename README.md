Pusher
=======

A Gearman worker for sending Apple push notifications using a persistent connection.


To Do
-----

 * Unique string for Gearman worker ID
 * Configurable queue name
 * Reconnecting protocol for Gearman
 * Reconnecting protocol for APNS
 * Restart APNS connection hourly
 * Idea: Poll feedback service & hit configurable webhook
 * Idea: Generic coiterator for getting jobs so we can plug in to other queues
